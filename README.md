# MetaGear Website Bug Fix (UNOFFICIAL)
this is an unofficial extension and has no connection to the metagear team. I just create it to solve some of my problems with the website.

✅ showing chassis slots position

✅ adding search by item name, level, energy to marketplace filters

✅ adding bsc scan button for NFT history to the machine part details page
